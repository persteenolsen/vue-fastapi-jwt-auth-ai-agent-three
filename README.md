# 🤖 vue-fastapi-jwt-ai-agent

Last updated 22-07-2026

A Vue 3 frontend using Pinia for state management and JWT authentication, designed to interact with a FastAPI AI Agent API.

This project demonstrates a complete AI agent frontend architecture:

SPA architecture → authentication → API integration → AI agent → tool execution → agent response display → local development → production build

The application provides an interface where users can ask questions and receive:

- AI-generated answers
- Agent actions
- Tool observations
- Error handling feedback

# FastAPI Backend

# 🔐 Features

- Vue 3 SPA architecture
- Pinia for global state management
- JWT authentication with bearer tokens
- Secure authenticated API requests
- AI agent question answering interface
- Agent action display
- Tool observation display
- Final answer display
- Error handling and feedback
- Development server with Vite
- Production-ready build and preview
- Environment-based API configuration
- Easy deployment to static hosting

# 🧱 Tech Stack

- Node.js 18.19.1
- Vue 3

# 📡 API Integration

The frontend communicates with protected FastAPI endpoints.

## Authentication

POST `/login-spa`

Returns a JWT access token:

Example response:

    {
      "access_token": "token-value",
      "token_type": "bearer",
      "username": "user"
    }

The token is stored in the authentication store and automatically included in API requests.

## AI Agent Chat

POST `/chat`

Example request:

    {
      "message": "Who is the CEO of Apple?"
    }

Example response:

    {
      "response": {
        "action": "Wikipedia",
        "action_input": "Apple CEO",
        "observation": "Timothy Donald Cook is an American business executive...",
        "final_answer": "The CEO of Apple is Tim Cook."
      }
    }

# 🧠 Key Design Features

- Global Pinia store for authentication state
- Dedicated Pinia store for AI agent state
- JWT bearer authentication handling
- Clean separation between frontend and backend logic
- Agent response parsing and display
- Tool action visibility for transparency
- Observation display for debugging and explainability
- Environment-based API configuration
- Vue SPA architecture

# 🤖 AI Agent Workflow

The frontend supports an agent workflow:

    User Question
          |
          v
    Vue Application
          |
          v
    FastAPI Agent API
          |
          v
    LLM Agent
          |
          +---- Tool Selection
          |
          +---- Tool Execution
          |
          +---- Observation
          |
          v
    Final Answer Returned To User

The user can see both the final answer and the intermediate agent information.
